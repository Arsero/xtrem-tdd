# Cards
In addition to this Knowledge Base, we wanted to propose cards that could:
- Help teams **identify smells** in their production code
- **Fill** the missing **gap** between code katas and production code

![Xtrem Smells Cards](../../images/xtrem-smells-cards.webp)

## How to use them
They have been designed to be used in several ways.

You just have to print them or use our [miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMuoRQIE=/?share_link_id=407336804543).

### Random Picking
In team:
- **Pick** a random card
- **Deep dive** into the card
    - Flash the QR Code
- **Look at** your current code base
- Try to **identify** the smell in it (if so)
- **Apply** the explained flavour if necessary

### Code Review
During a code review in mob:
- **Understand** the flavours on the cards (do not forget to flash the QR Code)
- **Select** the smells (cards) that you can identify in the code to review
- Try to **apply** the flavours you have identified

> What did you learn from it?
