# SAD - Software (or) System Architecture Document
## Description
A SAD is a general porpouse document that write down the intended architecture of the system/software in development. Goes fron a high level detail to a low level ADR list associated with the system/software. It uses text description and a wide range of visual description (diagrams, pictures, UML and others) to express and communicate the underling architecture.

## Why?


## Problems
Generate and mantain a SAD, solve the following problems:
    - Document the architecture of a System/Software
    - Important aspects of the system/software that needs explanaition, by writing down.
    - Detail complex solutions, algoriths, process.
    - Knowledgebase of the System/Software
    - Visibility, communication, collaboration.
    - Ensure quality of the System/Software by avoid obscurences of funcionality.

## How to
Write Down, using the simplest tool available, to document the Architecture of the Software/System.

<Explain how to start>
Make it as visual as possible with subtitles, code examples, images
