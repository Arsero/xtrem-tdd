# SAD - Software Architecture Document
## Description
A SAD is a general porpouse document that write down the intended architecture of the system/software in development. Goes fron a high level detail to a low level ADR list associated with the system/software. It uses text description and a wide range of visual description (diagrams, pictures, UML and others) to express and communicate the underling architecture.

## Why?

A SAD is a very important and helpful knowledge base for a given Software. Provides insight about how the system is made, how its work, its interfaces, componentes and all the desitions that were made during its development.

All this knowledge is useful to communicate the architecture, inprove, review and fix it.

## Problems
Generate and mantain a SAD, solve the following problems:
    - Document the architecture of a Software
    - Explain important aspects of the system/software that needs explanaition, by writing down.
    - Detail complex solutions, algoriths, process.
    - Knowledgebase of the Software
    - Visibility, communication, collaboration.
    - Ensure quality of the Software by avoid obscurences of funcionality.

## How to
Write Down, using the simplest tool available, to document the Architecture of the Software.

<Explain how to start>
Make it as visual as possible with subtitles, code examples, images
