## Pitch of the site
**Software engineering** has been around for decades.
Still, we tend to constantly spend time **investigating problems** that were **already solved** numerous times in the past.

**We've been there too** due to a lack of easy access to reliable information. This is precisely the purpose of this site : act as a mentor allowing you to find solutions and grow continuously.

It aims to provide solutions, ideas and resources to solve problems we've observed countless times like :
- I found my test suite being brittle, every change causes dozens of tests to fail
- I found our understanding of the business being approximate, we don't know what should happen in our domain
- I found we have a lot of Branches in our processes that throw exceptions, it makes it really hard to follow
- I found we often violate our Software Architecture principles, it creates a lot of tension
- I found my tests not providing a reliable output, debugging is always mandatory
- And much more...

While there can be discussions about choices and preferences, this book does not represent the opinion of an individual.
It is, in fact, a **collective effort** from **dozens of passionate experts** towards the same goal, accumulating more than a hundred years of professional experience together.

This site will be the perfect companion for your developer journey.
