# Factory pattern
#### *How to avoid direct object construction?*

## Description
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. 
This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method rather than by calling a constructor.

The Factory design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known "Gang of Four" design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems.
